# Thesis

All the codes used for simulating the cardiac behaviour is included here, dividing into their individual folders.
Note that the codes listed here are formatted to allow them to fit into the thesis margin without line breaking.

The link to the thesis is still pending and will be updated upon approval by the City, University of London's thesis depository.

## Hexahedral Elements

All chapter 3 codes are categorised in the Hexahedral folder, which sub-divides into the following folders:
| Folder Title | Thesis Section |
| --- | --- |
| Linear | 3.1 |
| Geometrically_Non-Linear | 3.2.1 |
| Material_Non-Linear | 3.2.2 - 3.2.4 |

A further ReadMe.md is included in each folder to describe the MATLAB files, input and out parameters and the algorithm process.
