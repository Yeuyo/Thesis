# Thesis

All the codes used for simulating the cardiac behaviour is included here, dividing into their individual folders.
Note that the codes listed here are formatted to allow them to fit into the thesis margin without line breaking.

The thesis can be found at https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/24692/.

Note: The codes here are written in a way that it best fit in the printed copy of the thesis. This results in the code being short and compact, making it easier to follow the process of the formulation and do not follow programming's best practices.

## Hexahedral Elements

All chapter 3 codes are categorised in the Hexahedral folder, which sub-divides into the following folders:
| Folder Title | Thesis Section |
| --- | --- |
| Linear | 3.1 |
| Geometrically_Non-Linear | 3.2.1 |
| Material_Non-Linear | 3.2.2 - 3.2.4 |

A further ReadMe.md is included in each folder to describe the MATLAB files, input and out parameters and the algorithm process.
